Description Linear regression : Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The simplest form of linear regression is simple linear regression, which involves a single independent variable. In this case, the relationship between the dependent variable \( y \) and the independent variable \( x \) is modeled by the equation \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \), where \( \beta_0 \) is the y-intercept, \( \beta_1 \) is

conclusion Linear regression : Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. By fitting a linear equation to observed data, it allows us to predict values and understand the strength and nature of relationships between variables. Its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness make it a widely used tool in various fields, from economics to biology. Despite its limitations, such as sensitivity to outliers and the assumption of linearity, linear regression remains a cornerstone of predictive modeling and statisticalÂ analysis.
